IAIC
-------
**ikes awkward irc client**

##Wait what, why, how?##
IAIC for lack of a better name is a Cocoa based irc client which at the moment lacks a lot of basic 
functionality (for example the connection dialog isn't there!), but what it does have as of so far is:
  - Ruby scripting support
  - PSMBarTabs
  - Based on Colloquy Core
  - webkit based so.. css themes  
  
Still a lot more work is needed, and one day.. anyway a picture is worth a thousand words here it is!
